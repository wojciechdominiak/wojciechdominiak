- ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name's Wojciech and I'm M.Eng of mechanical engineering. My interest in programming started back in 2012 in middle school. Since then
programming has been my hobby and Iâ€™ve also used it as an engineer in my work. As
my master thesis, I wrote a desktop application in Python for commercial
use. Now Iâ€™ve decided to expand my knowledge. I've been learning modern
frontend development for about one year. I've gained knowledge of advanced math
e.g. logic, analysis or algebra during my studies. Iâ€™ve been working creatively with
customers for two years. Currently I'm looking for a commercial job as a
programmer.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Next.js
