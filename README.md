- 👋 Hello! My name is Wojciech and I'm M.Eng of mechanical engineering. My
          interest in programming started back in 2012 in middle school. Since
          then programming has been my hobby and I have also used it as an
          engineer in my work. As my master thesis, I wrote a simple desktop
          application in Python for commercial use. It taught me a lot. Now I
          have decided to complete my knowledge. I've been learning modern
          frontend development for about one year. I've gained knowledge of
          advanced math e.g. logic, analysis or algebra during my studies. I
          have been working creatively with clients for two years. Now I'm
          looking for a commercial job as a programmer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Vue.js 3.0 - Composition API
